## I was told when I was young that there was no such thing as a "bad question"
Growing up, we were all told that asking questions was the key to being a lifelong learner. We should never be afraid to ask questions, no matter how dumb we might think we sound. I always believed this to be the truth. While a question itself can not be bad, the way it is communicated, on the other hand, can.

## Online Q&A Boards
### Yahoo! Answers
When I was younger, Yahoo! Answers was my go-to site for questions and answers. One could learn quite a bit by just browsing this site. Now a days though, Yahoo! Answers has a reputation for having really, really bad questions. It doesn't help that it has become a known [meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/yahoo-answers).

### Stack Overflow (and by extension, Stack Exchange)
So, what is Stack Exchange? It is an online Q&A board with an emphasis on computer-related technical questions. It is a part of the Stack Exchange network, an equivalent to the Yahoo! Answers. Today, at least for me, the Stack Exchange network has become the new Yahoo! Answers. It has a very strong community and has not (yet) become the joke that has doomed Yahoo! Answers.

## You say that Stack Exchange is not like Yahoo! Answers. Does that mean there are no bad questions?
No. Every website that allows people to freely interact and post content will inevitably have "shitposts". What I mean is that Stack Exchange doesn't have a *reputation* for low-quality content.
### Examples
#### Bad
[Here](http://stackoverflow.com/q/41888889) is a bad Stack Overflow question. Where do we begin? First of all, let me reinforce that questions that people have are not stupid. It is that the way questions are asked are bad. Reading this post, one would kind of get an idea of what the question is asking. The problem is that it is not detailed enough. It is not clear what the asker is looking for. No one wants to play the guessing game when trying to offer help. Always remember that most people who answer these questions are not being paid. Most people can't be bothered to waste time writing answers, only to be told later that it wasn't what the asker wanted. It is much easier to downvote a post than to probe for more details.
#### Good
