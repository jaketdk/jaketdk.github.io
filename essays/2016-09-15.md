## What is git?

Git is what is known as Version Control System (VCS). It was created by Linus Torvalds, partly out of spite of CVS (Concurrent Version System), another VCS. Linus, as many of you know, is known for writing the original Linux kernel - an open source implementation of UNIX.

Before git, there was CVS.
