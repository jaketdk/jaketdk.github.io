My first go at JavaScript was actually not in this class. Though not taught formally, I tried to make use of it. It was when I was at work messing around with VBScript that I was exposed to JavaScript (referred to as JScript by Microsoft for copyright reasons). I did not do much with it as I couldn't seem to get JScript to work in place of VBScript.

Scripting languages are some of my favorite because they are used to *do* things, not necessarily *make* things (though they can be).

##JavaScript. It's like Java but for scripting

Being that it was my first programming language, I love Java. It is very beginner friendly. If your priority is performance though, maybe Java isn't right for you.

JavaScript takes a lot of syntax from Java. This is why I love JavaScript. It was just a small learning curve I had to overcome to become familiar.

I am starting to understand the use for JavaScript in web development. It is what separates online resources from traditional media: interactivity. With just HTML, there isn't much room for speedy interaction and reaction.

##Athletic Software Engineering - WOD (WorkOut of the Day)

WODs! I love them! I can certainly see the value in doing timed exercises. If you can create small programs in a short amount of time, you will definitely be a better team-player when working with a development team. Being efficient with your time might not seem like much. I mean, what's a couple of minutes going to do? If you must ask yourself this, then consider this: what we do in these small WODs are just small parts to the greater software project. If it takes you an extra five minutes to a small snippet, imagine writing hundreds, if not more! Your wasted time would add up to something very significant.
