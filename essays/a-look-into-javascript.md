<img class="ui tiny right spaced image" src="../images/logo_JavaScript.png">*JavaScript is like baby Java!*

My first go at JavaScript was actually not in this class. Though not taught formally, I tried to make use of it. It was when I was at work messing around with VBScript that I was exposed to JavaScript (referred to as JScript by Microsoft for copyright reasons). I did not do much with it as I couldn't seem to get JScript to work in place of VBScript.

Scripting languages are some of my favorite because they are used to *do* things, not necessarily *make* things (though they can be).

## JavaScript. It's like Java but for scripting

Being that it was my first programming language, I love Java. It is very beginner friendly. If your priority is performance though, maybe Java isn't right for you.

JavaScript takes a lot of syntax from Java. This is why I love JavaScript. It was just a small learning curve I had to overcome to become familiar.

I am starting to understand the use for JavaScript in web development. It is what separates online resources from traditional media: interactivity. With just HTML, there isn't much room for speedy interaction and reaction.

## Athletic Software Engineering - WOD (WorkOut of the Day)

WODs! I love them! I can certainly see the value in doing timed exercises. If you can create small programs in a short amount of time, you will definitely be a better team-player when working with a development team. Being efficient with your time might not seem like much. I mean, what's a couple of minutes going to do? If you must ask yourself this, then consider this: what we do in these small WODs are just small parts to the greater software project. If it takes you an extra five minutes to a small snippet, imagine writing hundreds, if not more! Your wasted time would add up to something very significant.

### Practice WODs

The practice WODs are a great prep tool. While the actual WOD may differ greatly from the practice, you will at least get an idea of what the difficulty level of the upcoming WOD will be.

#### AmyWOD

AmyWODs are more practice WODs but are supposed to be similar to the real ones. I have not (and would likely never have) attended an AmyWOD. My work schedule falls on the times that AmyWODs are scheduled. I do wish I *could*, however. It seems I will have to just make due with the in-class practice. On the bright side, it will be more of a challenge.

## Flippin' flipped classrooms

What is a flipped classroom? It is a style of teaching that makes most of the passive learning (lecture, note-taking, etc.) is done at home on one's own free time and active learning (group work, practice problems, etc.) is done in the class. In theory, this works better because while you are applying new skills in the presence of the instructor, he or she can give useful advice and help while doing the assignments.

### Why this doesn't work for me

To say answer briefly, none of my other classes follow this format. This may not seem like much of an issue but when other classes have big assignments due before lecture, they will ultimately take precedence over passive study time. Almost anyone would agree that students should focus first on the things that have a direct impact on your grades.

### Don't get me wrong,

I definitely understand the idea of the flipped classroom. The good intentions are there, but I do not think it will work if only some college classes are taught this way. It is a good thing that I find Software Engineering to be a very engaging topic. If this was Art History, I don't think I would do very well.
