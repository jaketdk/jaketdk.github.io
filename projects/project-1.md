I always loved anything mechanical. When I was old enough to get a permit, I bought a moped. It was brand new but as with any vehicle produced these days, it was heavy and un-engaging. While it was reliable, I still wanted something fun and unique.

## Motorized Bicycle

Prior to all of this during one summer, a friend and I build a motorized bicycle. This wasn't any old motorized bicycle. This one has a gasoline engine. Most bikes out there have electric motors. While this was a fun project, it was difficult because things kept breaking. Bicycles were never meant to travel at highway speeds! Constantly repairing it got old fast.

## The purchase

Puch mopeds are hard to come by here in Hawaii. Most of them have rusted away after all these years. I found one guy who's hobby was restoring and building classic and custom mopeds. His name was Anthony. I knew what I wanted. After reading up on different models, I discovered that the Puch Maxi was the most common model sold in the US. It was a trade off because while that meant having one wouldn't be so unique, it did mean that getting parts for it wouldn't be too much of a hassle. I found Anthony and my grandparents came with me to his shop to pick up the bike.

## The bike and its issues

The moped did not run well when I bought it. Every bit of it was rusted, the suspension was terrible, and the engine and carburetor needed work. What I loved most about this bike was its simple design. The engine was not obscured by anything. It hung right out of the bottom of the frame.
