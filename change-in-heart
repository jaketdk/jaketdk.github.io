_**IN PROGRESS**_

I have always loved computers. My first computer was given to me by my dad. His workplace was throwing it away so he took it. It was one of those old beige Dell towers with a chunky CRT monitors. It was with this machine that I realized my one true love: technology.

This was back in the prime days of Windows 98. Windows XP had just come out but for a child, 98 ran all of the essentials. What more could you ask? As I ran through my entire library of games and programs, my mom decided it was time to expand my horizon. Thus, the 56k modem was installed.

Gaining access to the world wide web allowed me to expand my horizons. I would learn more and more about computers over time through my own self-motivation.

Growing up, I have not learned a single thing about computers that I had not already known. I was always helping others with their PC problems (sometimes even the teachers). I felt like I knew more about computers than my peers. I loved to help others. This would eventually become my dream job: IT.

I have always wanted to go into Information Technology. Ever since I outgrew the desire to follow in my father's footsteps, working with computers has always been a goal. While the University of Hawaii has an Management Information Systems program at the business school, a business degree never interested me. This left my only option to be with the Department of Information and Computer Sciences. Upon entry, I decided on a BS in Computer Science.

Computer Science was not something that I wanted to study but it was my best alternative. I always thought coding was boring and sucked. Despite this attitude, I enrolled in my first computer science classes as a freshman.

My first semester at UH, I took two ICS classes. One was Jason Leigh's ICS 111, Introduction to Computer Science I. The other was Kazuo Sugihara's ICS 241, Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science I.
